# Simple Obfuscation
This is a simple cpp file obfuscation for learning purposes. Not finished yet.

# How does it work
Currently, every command, function and string gets encrypted with a specific function. Right now this does only increase every char, but im going to change it to base64 or so. 
Compilation doesn't work.
